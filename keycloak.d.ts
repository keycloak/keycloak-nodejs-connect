     *
     * If no `spec` parameter is provided, the subsequent handlers will
     * be invoked if the user is authenticated, regardless of what roles
     * he or she may or may not have.
     *
     * If a user is not currently authenticated, the middleware will cause
     * the authentication workflow to begin by redirecting the user to the
     * Keycloak installation to login.  Upon successful login, the user will
     * be redirected back to the originally-requested URL, fully-authenticated.
     *
     * If a `spec` is provided, the same flow as above will occur to ensure that
     * a user it authenticated.  Once authenticated, the spec will then be evaluated
     * to determine if the user may or may not access the following resource.
     *
     * The `spec` may be either a `String`, specifying a single required role,
     * or a function to make more fine-grained determination about access-control
     *
     * If the `spec` is a `String`, then the string will be interpreted as a
     * role-specification according to the following rules:
     *
     *  - If the string starts with `realm:`, the suffix is treated as the name
     *    of a realm-level role that is required for the user to have access.
     *  - If the string contains a colon, the portion before the colon is treated
     *    as the name of an application within the realm, and the portion after the
     *    colon is treated as a role within that application.  The user then must have
     *    the named role within the named application to proceed.
     *  - If the string contains no colon, the entire string is interpreted as
     *    as the name of a role within the current application (defined through
     *    the installed `keycloak.json` as provisioned within Keycloak) that the
     *    user must have in order to proceed.
     *
     * Example
     *
     *     // Users must have the `special-people` role within this application
     *     app.get( '/special/:page', keycloak.protect( 'special-people' ), mySpecialHandler );
     *
     * If the `spec` is a function, it may take up to two parameters in order to
     * assist it in making an authorization decision: the access token, and the
     * current HTTP request.  It should return `true` if access is allowed, otherwise
     * `false`.
     *
     * The `token` object has a method `hasRole(...)` which follows the same rules
     * as above for `String`-based specs.
     *
     *     // Ensure that users have either `nicepants` realm-level role, or `mr-fancypants` app-level role.
     *     function pants(token, request) {
     *       return token.hasRole( 'realm:nicepants') || token.hasRole( 'mr-fancypants');
     *     }
     *
     *     app.get( '/fancy/:page', keycloak.protect( pants ), myPantsHandler );
     *
     * With no spec, simple authentication is all that is required:
     *
     *     app.get( '/complain', keycloak.protect(), complaintHandler );
     *
     * @param {String} spec The protection spec (optional)

    /**
     * Enforce access based on the given permissions. This method operates in two modes, depending on the `response_mode`
     * defined for this policy enforcer.
     *
     * If `response_mode` is set to `token`, permissions are obtained using an specific grant type. As a consequence, the
     * token with the permissions granted by the server is updated and made available to the application via `request.kauth.grant.access_token`.
     * Use this mode when your application is using sessions and you want to cache previous decisions from the server, as well automatically handle
     * refresh tokens. This mode is especially useful for applications acting as client and resource server.
     *
     * If `response_mode` is set to `permissions`, the server only returns the list of granted permissions (no oauth2 response).
     * Previous decisions are not cached and the policy enforcer will query the server every time to get a decision.
     * This is the default `response_mode`.
     *
     * You can set `response_mode` as follows:
     *
     *      keycloak.enforcer('item:read', {response_mode: 'token'})
     *
     * In all cases, if the request is already populated with a valid access token (for instance, bearer tokens sent by clients to the application),
     * the policy enforcer will first try to resolve permissions from the current token before querying the server.
     *
     * By default, the policy enforcer will use the `client_id` defined to the application (for instance, via `keycloak.json`) to
     * reference a client in Keycloak that supports Keycloak Authorization Services. In this case, the client can not be public given
     * that it is actually a resource server.
     *
     * If your application is acting as a client and resource server, you can use the following configuration to specify the client
     * in Keycloak with the authorization settings:
     *
     *      keycloak.enforcer('item:read', {resource_server_id: 'nodejs-apiserver'})
     *
     * It is recommended to use separated clients in Keycloak to represent your frontend and backend.
     *
     * If the application you are protecting is enabled with Keycloak authorization services and you have defined client credentials
     * in `keycloak.json`, you can push additional claims to the server and make them available to your policies in order to make decisions.
     * For that, you can define a `claims` configuration option which expects a `function` that returns a JSON with the claims you want to push:
     *
     *      app.get('/protected/resource', keycloak.enforcer(['resource:view', 'resource:write'], {
          claims: function(request) {
            return {
